## Projects:

### World Disasters in Context (Capstone Python Project)

This project, completed with Python for my Data Sciecne Capstone class, combines world disaster event data with World Bank country indicator data to place historical disasters events in a given country's developmental context. Understanding historical disasters by their type, impact, and development level is crucial to gain information about how different disasters affect different countries. From this information, officials can set goals for disaster management and adequately assess disaster risk comparatively by country. The goal of this analysis is to mitigate disasters' impact by increasing awareness about disasters and providing relevant resources to disaster management officials.

### Baseball Over the Last 40 Years (R Project)
This project, completed with R for my Data Visualization class, looks at how and why important metrics in baseball like hits, home runs, and strikeouts have changed over the last 40 years. The project begins by using a correlation chart and scatter plots to show that strikeouts and home runs have increased over time while hits have decreased. To answer the question of why strikeouts and home runs have increased, I performed a regression analysis to first show that strikeouts and home runs are positively correlated. I then performed another regression analysis showing that home runs are more of a predictor for runs than hits. Scatter plots for home runs vs. runs and hits vs. runs confirmed this relationship. By analyzing the relationship between variables like hits, home runs, strikeouts, and runs, I was able to discern that teams have prioritized home runs over hits and strikeouts to score more runs. 

This project contains many interactive visualizations. Check it out [here](https://harrissamuel.github.io/projects/baseball_changes_over_last_40_years/Final_project.html). 

### Fantasy Football Regression Model (Python Project)
This project, completed with Python for personal use, used linear regression with K-fold cross-validation to predict fantasy football points per game for wide receivers and running backs. The goal of this model was to predict fantasy points using predetermined features and find overrated and underrated players based on the model. K-fold cross-validation was used to avoid overfitting the model. The model produced high correlation values with the predicted values versus the real values indicating an effective model. I used the Sklearn package for the regression model and the K fold splitting of the data into training and test sets.

### Costs of Climate Change (R Project)

This project, completed in R for my Data Science for All class, examines what areas of the US are experiencing the most climate change and the extent to which changes in temperature and precipitation data are correlated with disaster cost data. I gathered precipitation and temperature data and drought and wildfire disaster data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. By analyzing summary statistics from county-level climate data, the West and Southwest regions of the US showed the most climate change. The disaster data showed that disasters and disaster costs have increased over time since the records began being tracked in 1980. By using linear regression with the climate and disaster cost data from the West and Southwest, results revealed that there was a general negative correlation between precipitation change and disaster costs and a general positive correlation between temperature change and disaster costs. Maps and visualizations are used extensively in this R project to back up my conclusions.

### Painting Web Scraper (Python Project)

This project, completed with Python for personal use, used BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape information about paintings from a website. The goal of this project was to loop through each painting on the HTML website and extract information like the title, price, height, and width. Selenium was used to interact with the website and BeautifulSoup to parse through the HTML code. The data was gathered and put into a CSV file for further use.
